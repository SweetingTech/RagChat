To create a custom node in ComfyUI, follow these steps:
1. Open your code editor and create a new Python file. Name it something descriptive, such as "my_custom_node.py".
2. Import the necessary modules by adding the following lines to the top of your file:
import os
import json
from comfyui import Node
3. Define the class for your custom node. In this example, we'll create a simple node that takes two inputs and returns their sum:
class MyCustomNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, inputs, outputs):
        super().__init__(inputs, outputs)
4. Override the process method to handle the logic for your node. In this case, we'll add the following code:
def process(self, data):
    inputs = self.get_input("input1") + self.get_input("input2")
    return {"output": int(inputs)}
5. Save your file and open ComfyUI.
6. In the "Nodes" tab, click on the "Add Node" button.
7. Select "Custom Node" from the dropdown menu.\n
